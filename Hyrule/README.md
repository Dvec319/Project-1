# Technologies Used

# Features
### This search tool will allow you to search for something inside of the compendium, say a monster like a Moblin and have it pull the relevant information to display on the screen.

# Expected Timeline
### Over the next few days I will spend my time getting the styling and responsive design of the website ready before injecting any javascript into the project itself. I should be able to get the javascript squared away in one day and after that I will attempt to incoporate some bonuse features. This could be search history displaying previous searches the user has made.
