# Hyrule Compendium Searcher

### A search tool used to look up various entires in the Hyrule Compendium API and display them.

# Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Google Fonts
- Hyrule Compendium API

# Features

### This search tool will allow you to search for something inside of the compendium, say a monster like a Moblin and have it pull the relevant information to display on the screen. It will display the picture of said search entry along with it's name, description, common locations, and also it's drops. It will also have a responsive design.

# Expected Timeline

### Over the next few days I will spend my time getting the styling and responsive design of the website ready before injecting any javascript into the project itself. I should be able to get the javascript squared away in one day and after that I will attempt to incoporate some bonuse features. This could be search history displaying previous searches the user has made.

# Unsolved Problems

### I had a really tough time thinking of a nice design for responsive/mobile devices. I talked it over with Kyle and he gave the idea of maybe making a DS or Gameboy Advance but I didn't really see a way to implement it in a way that didn't look way too small or very squished together.
